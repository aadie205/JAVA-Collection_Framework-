public  String[] split(String delimit)
				1. its parameter is regex
				2. if the given argument string has special meaning as per regex
						the current string will be split with the matched characters
						Ex: "." --> all characters are considered as delimeter
									finally we will get empty string
								"[abc]" string is split by the characters a, b and c
								"[a-z]" strnig is split by the any letter
						
						-if we want to treat a regular expression character as normal 
						character, we must prefix \\ as "\\." it is consider as . only
						
						 -if we want to treat normal character as regex 
						 we must place it in [] as [abc]
						 								
				3. if the given argument string does not have any special meaning
					the current string will be split by the given character it self
						Ex: "a", string is split by the letter "a"
						
				4. if given argument string is completely equal to current string
						then empty array  will be return with 0 tokens
				

				5. if given argument string is not matched with any character
						in current string, current string will be return as one token
														  
			 	6. for the given argument string LEFT token is not found,
			 		but RIGHT token is found, as LEFT token it includes empty string
			 		
			 	7. if we pass empty string "" as delimiter,
			 		each character will be return as a token
			 		
			 	8. split method is available from JDK 1.4 version onwards
			 		before JDK 1.4 we use StringTokenizer class
